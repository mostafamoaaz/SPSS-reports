# SPSS-reports
these are reports i was working on during a Data Analyst internship, the work was carried on by IBM SPSS software then we report our insights in a form of Q&A 
you can find the data in each folder as a sav file format and the reports in a pdf file and another pdf file for the dataset description
### these researches required alot of statistical testing knowledge which i am going to mention some examples below, it also required a powerful tool to make these tests where SPSS become so much valuable

some of the tests are :
* normality tests
* shipro-wilk 
* kertosis
* correlations
* linear & non linear regression
* T tests
* Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
* two way ANOVA
